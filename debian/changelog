ros-dashing-launch (0.5.1-1bionic) bionic; urgency=high

  * Changed the behavior when signaling SIGINT to subprocesses on Windows, where it now does SIGTERM instead, because SIGINT causes a ValueError about SIGINT being an unsupported signal number. (#94 <https://github.com/ros2/launch/issues/94>)
  * Fixed a bug by avoiding reentrancy in the SIGINT signal handler. (#92 <https://github.com/ros2/launch/issues/92>)
  * Various Windows fixes. (#87 <https://github.com/ros2/launch/issues/87>)
    * LaunchService.run() now returns non-0 when there are exceptions in coroutines.
    * Updated ``launch_counters.py`` example for Windows.
    * Fixed a bug that would cause mismatched asyncio loops in some futures.
    * Addressed the fact that ``signal.SIGKILL`` doesn’t exist on Windows, so emulate it in our Event.
    * Fixed an issue that resulted in spurious asyncio errors in LaunchService test.

  * [for launch.legacy] Fix hang on keyboard interrupt (#69 <https://github.com/ros2/launch/issues/69>)
    * When keyboard interrupt exception occurs loop.run_forever is called. But there is no loop.stop call. This causes a hang.
